# Quality measures of image filtering algorithms for 5 scales of Gaussian noises
# First line always refers to the name of quality measured
# Second line stores the values of scales of noise (with name at the first pos)
# Then, algorithms' quality measures are enumerated following these scales (no limit on numbers) 
# Important: values are seperated by tabs (\t)
